We will use the elemapi2 data file. 400 elementary schools from the California Department of
Educationâ€™s API 2000 dataset. This data file contains a measure of
school academic performance as well as other attributes of the
elementary schools, such as, class size, enrollment, poverty.

We will focus on the variables mealcat, and collcat as they relate to the outcome variable api00 (performance on the api in the year 2000. The variable mealcat is the variable meals 
broken up into three categories, and the variable collcat is the variable some_col broken into 3 categories. We could think of mealcat as 
being the number of students receiving free meals and broken up into low, middle and high. The variable collcat can be thought of as the number of parents with some college education, 
and we could think of it as being broken up into low, medium and high.
