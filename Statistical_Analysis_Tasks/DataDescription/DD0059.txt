We have a hypothetical dataset named 'mvreg' with 600 observations on seven variables. the psychological variables are locus of control (locus_of_control), self-concept (self_concept),
and motivation (motivation). The academic variables are standardized tests scores in reading (read), writing (write), and science (science),
as well as a categorical variable (prog) giving the type of program the student is in (general, academic, or vocational).
