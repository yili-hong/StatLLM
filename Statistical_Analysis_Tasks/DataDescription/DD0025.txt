1, Name: iron
2. Data Set Information: 
Thirteen specimens of 90/10 Cu-Ni alloys are tested in a corrosion-wheel setup in order to examine corrosion. Each specimen has a certain iron content. The wheel is rotated in salt seawater at 30 ft/sec for 60 days. Weight loss is used to quantify the corrosion. The fe variable represents the iron content, and the loss variable denotes the weight loss in milligrams/square decimeter/day.
3. Attribute Information:
Number of Obs: 13
Number of Variables: 2
Attribute: Attribute Range
(1). fe: continuous from 0.01 to 1.96.
(2). Loss: continuous from 83.7 to 130.1.
