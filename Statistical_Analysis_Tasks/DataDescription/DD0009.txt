For each of the 9 horses, a veterinary anatomist measured the density of nerve cells at specified sites in the intestine. The results for site I (mid region of jejunum) and site II (mesenteric region of jejunum) are measured. Each density value is the average of counts of nerve cells in 5 equal sections of tissue.  

The variable horse gives the id for the horse.
The variable site1 gives the measures at site 1. 
The variable site2 gives the measures at site 2.
The dataset is named as horse.
