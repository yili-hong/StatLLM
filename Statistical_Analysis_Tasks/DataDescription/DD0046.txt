The dataset hernio_uv is a transformed version of the original hernio dataset, which contains medical data on patients undergoing hernia surgery. In the original dataset hernio, key variables include patient (a unique identifier for each patient), age (the patientâ€™s age), OKstatus (an indicator of the patient's health status post-surgery), leave (a binary variable indicating whether the patient left), and los (length of stay in the hospital, measured as a count).

In hernio_uv, the structure has been modified to create a more flexible format for analysis across different types of response variables and distributions. For each record in hernio, two rows are generated in hernio_uv: one where the response variable is set to leave (with the distribution type "Binary") and another where the response variable is set to los (with the distribution type "Poisson"). This transformation allows for comparative analysis of binary and count-based outcomes. The resulting dataset contains the variables patient, age, OKstatus, response, and dist, and facilitates statistical modeling or hypothesis testing across the two response types.
