1, Name: ART

2. Data Set Information: 
A random sample of fourteen elementary school students is selected from a school, and each student is measured on a creativity score ( X ) using a new testing instrument and on a task score ( Y ) using a standard instrument. The task score is the mean time taken to perform several hand â€“ eye coordination tasks. Because administering the creativity test is much cheaper, the researcher wants to know if the CREATE score is a good substitute for the more expensive TASK score. The data are shown below in the following SAS code that creates a SAS data set named ART with variables SUBJECT, CREATE and TASK. Note that the SUBJECT variable is of character type so the name is followed by a dollar sign ($).
