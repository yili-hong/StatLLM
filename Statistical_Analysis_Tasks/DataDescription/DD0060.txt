 The measurements in the dataset fitness were made on men involved in a physical   
 fitness course at N.C.State Univ. The variables are Age      
 (years), Weight (kg), Oxygen intake rate (ml per kg body     
 weight per minute), time to run 1.5 miles (minutes), heart   
 rate while resting, heart rate while running (same time      
 Oxygen rate measured), and maximum heart rate recorded while 
 running.
