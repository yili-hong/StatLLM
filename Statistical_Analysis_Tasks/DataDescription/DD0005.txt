college-aged adults need at least 7 hours of sleep each night to stay healthy. Sleep deprivation can lead to decreased immune system function, lack of concentration, and poor memory. In the data set, a simple random sample of college students reports the number of hours of sleep they had last night. 

The variable time is the response, which gives the number of hours of sleep. 
The dataset is named as sleeptime.
