Data Description for SAS Dataset: AUTO

This dataset consists of automotive data including specifications and pricing for various car models. The dataset contains the following variables:

1. make (Character, Length = 20): The manufacturer and model of the car.
2. price (Numeric): The list price of the car in US dollars.
3. mpg (Numeric): Miles per gallon, indicating the fuel efficiency of the car.
4. rep78 (Numeric): Repair record from 1978, rated on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).
5. hdroom (Numeric): Headroom inside the car, measured in inches.
6. trunk (Numeric): Trunk space, measured in cubic feet.
7. weight (Numeric): Weight of the car, measured in pounds.
8. length (Numeric): Length of the car, measured in inches.
9. turn (Numeric): Turning circle of the car, measured in feet.
10. displ (Numeric): Engine displacement, measured in cubic centimeters.
11. gratio (Numeric): Gear ratio of the car.
12. foreign (Numeric): Binary indicator where 0 = Domestic car and 1 = Foreign car.

Data Input Method:
The data is input using the CARDS statement, which indicates that the data follows the INPUT statement line by line in the program file. Each line corresponds to a different car model with its respective specifications.
