The data set name is ART with variables SUBJECT, CREATE and TASK. A random sample of fourteen elementary school students is selected from a school, and each student is measured on a creativity score ( CREATE ) using a new testing instrument and on a task score ( TASK ) using a standard instrument. The task score is the mean time taken to perform several hand â€“ eye coordination tasks. Because administering the creativity test is much cheaper, the researcher wants to know if the CREATE score is a good substitute for the more expensive TASK score. 
Note that the SUBJECT variable is of character type so the name is followed by a dollar sign ($).
