2. Data Set Information: 
This is a simulated data:
A multivariate data set with 10 independent variables and one dependent variable was simulated from a
known “true” model that is a linear function of a subset of the independent variables. SAS code is used to simulate 1000 observations for these 10 independent X variables and one dependent Y variable. The 10 independent X variables come from normal, lognormal, exponential and uniform distributions with various means and variances. Variables X5, X6 and X9 are correlated with other variables. The 10 independent X variables come from normal, lognormal, exponential and uniform distributions with various means and variances. Variables X5, X6 and X9 are correlated with other variables.
