The BMT (bone marrow transplant) data set is used to illustrate survival analysis methods (Klein and Moeschberger 1997).
At the time of transplant, each patient is classified into one of three risk categories: ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), 
AML-Low Risk (acute myelocytic leukemia, low risk), and AML-High Risk. The endpoint of interest is the disease-free survival time, 
which is the time in days to death, relapse, or the end of the study. 


The variable Group represents the patientâ€™s risk category, 
the variable T represents the disease-free survival time, and the variable Status is the censoring indicator such that the value 1 indicates an event time 
and the value 0 indicates a censored time.
