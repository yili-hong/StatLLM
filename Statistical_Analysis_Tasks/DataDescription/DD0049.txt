Example 1:  Suppose that we are interested in the factors that influence whether a political candidate wins an election.  
The outcome (response) variable is binary (0/1);  win or lose. The predictor variables of interest are the amount of money spent on the campaign, 
the amount of time spent campaigning negatively, and whether the candidate is an incumbent. Example 2:  A researcher is interested in how variables, 
such as GRE (Graduate Record Exam scores), GPA (grade point average) and prestige of the undergraduate institution, effect admission into graduate school. 
The outcome variable, admit/donâ€™t admit, is binary.

Description of the data
For our data analysis below, we are going to expand on Example 2 about getting into graduate school.  We have generated hypothetical data, which can be obtained from our website by clicking
on https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/binary.sas7bdat. You can store this anywhere you like, but the syntax below assumes it has been stored in the directory c:data.
This data set has a binary response (outcome, dependent) variable called admit, which is equal to 1 if the individual was admitted to graduate school, and 0 otherwise. 
There are three predictor variables: gre, gpa, and rank. We will treat the variables gre and gpa as continuous. The variable rank takes on the values 1 through 4. 
Institutions with a rank of 1 have the highest prestige, while those with a rank of 4 have the lowest. We start out by looking at some descriptive statistics.
