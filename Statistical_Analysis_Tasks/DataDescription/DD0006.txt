Suppose there is a study to compare two study methods and see how they improve the grades differently. There is a new method (treament, or t) and a standard method (control, or c). Users will be randomly assigned either one method. After they are trained with the method, their performance is measured as grades.  

The variable Grade is the response, which gives the grade.
The variable Method is categorical and gives the treatment or control.  
The dataset is named as read.
