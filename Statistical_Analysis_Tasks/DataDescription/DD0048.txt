The pred.csv provides the average api00 (API performance in 2000) for each combination of the categorical variables mealcat and collcat. This summary allows us to observe how different levels of these variables interact and contribute to variations in API performance. These predicted means serve as cell means, representing the central tendency of api00 within each group, and are essential for visualizing and comparing group-level patterns through graphs.
