For the sashelp.baseball dataset, which is avaialle through SAS help files, Suppose you want to investigate whether you can model the playersâ€™ salaries for the 1987 season based on batting statistics for the previous season and lifetime batting performance. Since the variation in salaries is much greater for higher salaries, it is appropriate to apply a log transformation for this analysis.  

The dependent variable is logSalary.
The independent variables are nhits, nruns, nrbi, nbb, yrmajor, and crhits.
The id variables are name, team, and league.
