* Assume highlow dataset is already loaded into the SAS environment;

* 1. Calculate log transformation of DowHigh;
data transformed;
    set highlow;  * Load the highlow dataset;
    DowHigh_log = log(DowHigh);  * Compute the log transformation;
run;

* 2. Sort the data by year to ensure the plot orders data points correctly;
proc sort data=transformed;
    by year;
run;

* 3. Plot the Log transformation of DowHigh for each Year;
proc sgplot data=transformed;
    series x=year y=DowHigh_log / markers;
    xaxis label='Year';
    yaxis label='Log of Dow High';
    title 'Log Transformation of Dow High by Year';
run;
