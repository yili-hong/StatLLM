* Load the dataset if it's from an external file, otherwise assume the dataset is already in the work library;
* Example: If the dataset is in a CSV file, you might use the PROC IMPORT step or other data input methods.
* Here, I will assume the dataset is already in the SAS work library under the name 'highlow'.

proc sort data=highlow;
    by year;
run;

* Use PROC SGPLOT to create a line plot of the DowJonesHigh for each year;
proc sgplot data=highlow;
    series x=year y=dowjoneshigh / markers markerattrs=(symbol=circlefilled size=8 color=blue) lineattrs=(color=blue);
    xaxis label="Year";
    yaxis label="Dow Jones Yearly High";
    title "Yearly High Values of the Dow Jones Industrial Average";
run;
