* Assuming mvreg data is already loaded in SAS;
* If not, you would need a data import step here using PROC IMPORT;

* Convert categorical variable 'prog' into dummy variables;
proc glm data=mvreg;
   class prog; * Declares 'prog' as a categorical variable;
   model locus_of_control self_concept motivation = read write science prog / solution;
   title 'Multivariate Regression Model';
run;
quit;

* Checking for multicollinearity among independent variables;
proc reg data=mvreg;
   model read=write science;
   model write=read science;
   model science=read write;
run;
quit;

* Checking correlations for all variables;
proc corr data=mvreg;
   var locus_of_control self_concept motivation read write science;
   with prog;
run;
quit;
