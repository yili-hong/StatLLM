* Step 1: Fit the regression model;
proc glm data=baseball;
   class league division;  /* In case you want to include categorical predictors later */
   model logSalary = nhits nruns nrbi nbb yrmajor crhits;
   output out=regout predicted=pred_logsalary residual=residual;
run;
quit;

* Step 2: Check the results and diagnostics;
proc print data=regout;
   var nhits nruns nrbi nbb yrmajor crhits logSalary pred_logsalary residual;
run;

* Additional analysis or diagnostics can be performed here with the data;
* For example, you can create scatter plots or use PROC UNIVARIATE to look at summaries;

* Step 3: Create a final dataset containing only the actual and predicted values;
data predictions;
   set regout;
   keep logSalary pred_logsalary;
run;

* Step 4: View the dataset with actual and predicted log salaries;
proc print data=predictions;
   title "Actual vs. Predicted Log Salaries for Baseball Players";
run;
