* Create a new dataset with logarithmic transformations;
data highlow_log;
    set highlow;
    
    * Assume the columns for yearly high and low values are named HighValue and LowValue respectively;
    LogDowHigh = log(HighValue);
    LogDowLow = log(LowValue);
run;

* Compute descriptive statistics;
proc means data=highlow_log mean std;
    var LogDowHigh LogDowLow;
run;
