/* Note: 
  In this code, we assume that the data is not already available in SAS and create a temporary dataset 'smoke' with the given data.
  The 'model' statement is used to specify the logistic regression model. The 'event' option is used to specify the event of interest (i.e., student_smoke = 1).
  The 'freq' statement is used to specify the frequency variable 'count'.
  The 'units' statement is used to specify the units for the change in the odds ratio.
  The 'estimate' statement is used to calculate the odds ratio and its confidence interval.
