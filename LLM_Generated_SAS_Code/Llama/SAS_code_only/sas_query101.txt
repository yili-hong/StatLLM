/* Import the dataset */
data manova;
  /* You need to import your data here, since I don't have access to it.
     Here is an example of how you might do it using a csv file: */
  set manova;
  input group useful difficulty importance;
run;

/* Calculate the correlation matrix */
proc corr data=manova nosimple;
  var useful difficulty importance;
run;

/* Optionally, you can use proc corr with pearson option
   for Pearson's product-moment correlations. By default,
   SAS uses Pearson's if not otherwise specified. */

proc corr data=manova nosimple pearson ;
  var useful difficulty importance;
run;

/*
The output will include:
- a table of statistics including N (number of observations), Mean and Std Dev.
- tables showing Pearson Correlation Coefficients
